# Cursor Rules for Bio Age Project

## CRITICAL: Process Management
- **NEVER kill user processes or browsers** without explicit permission
- **NEVER use `kill -9` or similar commands** that force-terminate processes
- **ALWAYS ask before terminating any running processes**
- **Check if port is in use** before starting server, but ask user how to handle conflicts

## Server Management
- When port 8001 is in use, ask user: "Port 8001 is already in use. Would you like me to: 1) Stop the existing process, 2) Use a different port, or 3) You handle it manually?"
- **Never automatically kill processes** - always get user confirmation first
- If server fails to start, suggest alternatives rather than force-killing

## Code Changes
- **Always explain what changes you're making** before making them
- **Test changes incrementally** rather than making large changes at once
- **Preserve user's work** - don't overwrite files without clear explanation

## Communication
- **Be explicit about what commands you're running**
- **Explain the purpose of each command**
- **Ask for permission before making system-level changes**
- **Provide clear status updates** about what's happening

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- This is a facial analysis application with MediaPipe integration
- Handle MediaPipe import issues carefully
- Preserve existing facial region detection logic
- Maintain the medical-tech UI design aesthetic
- Test changes thoroughly before suggesting them

## Error Handling
- **Don't panic when errors occur** - analyze and explain them
- **Provide clear error explanations** and suggested solutions
- **Ask user preference** for how to handle errors
- **Don't make assumptions** about what the user wants

## File Management
- **Don't delete files** without explicit permission
- **Backup important changes** when making modifications
- **Explain file structure changes** clearly
- **Preserve user's existing work**

Remember: The user's workflow and open applications are more important than the assistant's convenience. Always prioritize user experience and ask before making disruptive changes.
